Lets you automatically send mass emails from a google spreadsheet with customizable applications, sender name, emails, etc.

The code is written in the google scripts language and can be found in the code file.

The link to the spreadsheet template which corresponds with the code is at:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vd0v9PNfU5KtVHeUytPDX-6CoL-iNCGJ4tWSfua7G-Q/edit?usp=sharing

In order to use the template, first make a copy of the spreadsheet. Once this is done, open the script editor and paste the code in. Edit the spreadsheet as you see fit and then hit the run button in the script editor to send the emails. If you change the purpose of any of the columns (like name to email), make the corresponding changes in the script editor.
